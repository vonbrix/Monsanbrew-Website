                <h2>About The <span> Owner </span></h2>
                <h5>Diether Jan Labaguis Monsanto</h5>
                <p>Diether Jan, famously known as Diet, is a 26 year old business owner residing at Barangay Dos, Gasan, Marinduque.</p>
                <p><span>What inspired you to start Monsanbrew?</span></p>
                <p><span><em>"At first, I just enjoyed drinking hot coffee but I wanted to experience it in different flavors. So, I tried making some, and my family and friends loved it. That got me thinking, maybe I could try it with iced coffee. I gave iced coffee a shot, and it became a hit. That's when I decided to try selling it online."</em></span></p>
                <p>He first launched Monsanbrew online on September 21, 2021. After months of online sales, he upgraded with a food cart on April 16, 2022, followed by selling in tents in June 2022. Finally, on September 24, 2022, he proudly opened his own coffee shop.</p>
                <p><span>Any Message for Small Business Owners?</span></p>
                <p><span><em>"Consistency! That's the key. I've reached a point where I wanted to give up, saying, 'Enough! It's exhausting.' But what stuck with me is, we can't afford to get tired because we're not rich. So even when you're at the peak of surrender, just keep going!"</em></span></p>
